## How to run the source code?
Since we programmed Ponder Quiz in Flutter, you have to download a couple things before you can successfully run Flutter on your machine.

* NOTE: Ponder Quiz is a fully functional application and runs fairly error free, however while testing and migrating different workstations we noticed that it wouldn't always compile right either because of android studio gradle builds or even in the instablilty of the FLutter Framework.
* NOTE: Flutter is still a developing framework and still has its faults, in this section we will attempt to walk through the steps, errors, and best practices to ensure that the Ponder source code can be run effortlessly.

We highly recommend you follow the official installation process for Flutter at https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install, Flutter is supported by three operating sytems and each has an in-depth guide on installing Flutter.

* NOTE: Prior to the step please make you have installed Flutter, Android SDK and preferably Android Studio.

* Running Flutter in Visual Studio Code

Flutter can be run in Microsofts Visual Studio code, making it a fast and easily accessible framework.

1. Install the Flutter sdk
2. Next, use Microsoft Visual Studio Code to load the project folder into the IDE
3. Wait for Microsoft Visual Studio Code to analyze the project, then open a Powershell (Windows 10) or Terminal (macOS) window
4. Run 'flutter clean'
5. Then run 'flutter packages get'
6. Microsoft Visual Code will then reanalyze the project
7. Open a simulator in Microsoft Visual Studio Code and then enter 'flutter run' into the Powershell (Windows 10) or Terminal (macOS) window
